# TestBt
I need to make a c++ program to connect to a bluetooth device with NAP (Network Access Point) protocol (Bluetooth tethering).

In details I need to do this operations programmatically from c++ code:

Search for the bluetooth device
Pairing the selected device
(At this point I see that a new network connection is available)
Do the “Join to Personal Area Network”
Connect to the device using an access point
Receive the “connection successful” notification

Disconnect from the device network
Remove the device
